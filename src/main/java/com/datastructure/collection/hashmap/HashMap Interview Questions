Q1) If hashcode() method of an object always returns 0 then what will be the impact on the 
functionality of software ? 

Hashcode is used to fairly distribute elements inside a map into individual buckets. 
If the hashcode returned is zero for each element then the distribution will no more be fair 
and all the elements will end up into a single bucket. Each bucket in a HashMap contains list of HashEntry objects, 
so in a way HashMap will act as a map with single bucket holding all of its elements in a list. 
That will drastically reduce HashMap's performance to that of a LinkedList for get and put operations. 
So time complexity of get and put method will become : 
Big O(n) instead of Big O(1) Although, functionally it will still behave correctly.

Q2) If we don't override hashcode() while using a object in hashing collection, what will be the impact ? 

Then the Object's default hashcode() method will be used to calculate the hashcode, 
which in turn will return the memory address of the object in hexadecimal format. 
So in a way the hashmap will behave like a identity hashmap which will consider two elements equal if and only 
if two objects are same as per their memory address (and not logically). 
For example two String Objects with same contents might be treated different by this hashmap if they are different on heap.
