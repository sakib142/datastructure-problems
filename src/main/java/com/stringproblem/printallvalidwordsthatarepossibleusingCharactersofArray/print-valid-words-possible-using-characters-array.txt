<------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Given a dictionary and a character array, print all valid words that are possible using characters from the array.

Examples:

Input : Dict - {"go","bat","me","eat","goal", 
                                "boy", "run"} 
        arr[] = {'e','o','b', 'a','m','g', 'l'} 
Output : go, me, goal.

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to use Trie data structure to store dictionary, then search words in Trie using characters of given array.

Create an empty Trie and insert all words of given dictionary into the Trie.
After that, we have pick only those characters in ‘Arr[]’ which are a child of the root of Trie.
To quickly find whether a character is present in array or not, we create a hash of character arrays.
