1) Scenario based question on Immutable classes (How will achieve the immutability of a mutable class without the creation on new Object ? Why we require new Object creation inside the constructor, Why not in getter method?)


2) Composition and Inheritance (Which one will you use and in which scenario ? Which is more tightly coupled ? Gave few scenarios and asked what to use and why ?

3) What is Atomic ? How it works internally ? Why to use it ?


4) Why not volatile? when to use volatile ? Asked this question with few scenarios


5) UnBoxing and AutoBoxing - What is this ? why to use ?
	int i=5;
	Integer i1 =i;  -----> Will this work ?

	Integer i= 1
	int i1 =i;  -----> Will this work ?
	
	How it works internally ? Who handles this ? Is it Compiler ?
